# Hi, I'm Ali! 👋

  
## 🚀 About Me

🎓 Western University, Canada dual-degree graduate with a Bachelor of Engineering Science in Mechatronic Systems Engineering and a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. (Spring 2021)

🌇 I am currently working as an embedded software engineer in training, with a passion for coding and developing embedded products and scripts.

📚 For experience, at my 16-month internship, I was responsible for maintaining and developing high-quality tools using C/C++, Python, and Golang for department and customer use. After a few months, I became the go-to guy for the company's Event-Driven-Development (EDD) system and was responsible for maintaining and improving it. This experience taught me a great deal about software development, maintanence, and debugging. I have since returned to the company after graduating and continue to develop my skills in the IoT sector.

💬 Outside of work, I've worked on a couple of Arduino side projects which I'm always happy to talk about with people, and am currently looking into making projects with the Raspberry Pi, while also learning the basics of web development through Linkedin Learning.

🏔 In my free time, you can find me watching sitcoms, listening to music, and working out.

💼 I'm interested in development opportunities where I can put my skills and experiences to practical use and continue to be challenged and grow as a software developer.
